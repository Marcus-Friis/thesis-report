  abstract = {An intensely debated topic is whether political polarization on social media is on the rise. We can investigate this question only if we can quantify polarization, by taking into account how extreme the opinions of the people are, how much they organize into echo chambers, and how these echo chambers organize in the network. Current polarization estimates are insensitive to at least one of these factors: They cannot conclusively clarify the opening question. Here, we propose a measure of ideological polarization that can capture the factors we listed. The measure is based on the generalized Euclidean distance, which estimates the distance between two vectors on a network, e.g., representing people’s opinion. This measure can fill the methodological gap left by the state of the art and leads to useful insights when applied to real-world debates happening on social media and to data from the U.S. Congress. A previously unknown measure for estimating ideological divergence in social networks is used to study polarization.}

This article takes a closer look at the emergence of one such app—Musical.ly (i.e., TikTok as we know it today). Using the social construction of technology as a theoretical lens, the article demonstrates how Musical.ly was co-constructed through the interplay among the app, its users (preteens), and nonusers (parents and regulatory bodies), while acknowledging the specific social and cultural context in which it emerged. The article argues that parents’ and preteens’ diverging interpretations of Musical.ly as a creativity tool, on one hand, and an adult-free social network centered around performativity and play, on the other, appeased moral panic that typically surrounds children’s digital media use and supported the app’s rapid uptake. },

abstract = { Social media users have long been aware of opaque content moderation systems and how they shape platform environments. On TikTok, creators increasingly utilize algospeak to circumvent unjust content restriction, meaning, they change or invent words to prevent TikTok’s content moderation algorithm from banning their video (e.g., “le\$bean” for “lesbian”). We interviewed 19 TikTok creators about their motivations and practices of using algospeak in relation to their experience with TikTok’s content moderation. Participants largely anticipated how TikTok’s algorithm would read their videos, and used algospeak to evade unjustified content moderation while simultaneously ensuring target audiences can still find their videos. We identify non-contextuality, randomness, inaccuracy, and bias against marginalized communities as major issues regarding freedom of expression, equality of subjects, and support for communities of interest. Using algospeak, we argue for a need to improve contextually informed content moderation to valorize marginalized and tabooed audiovisual content on social media.}

Here I survey the status of this problem in 2016, for a broad audience of mathematicians, scientists, and engineers. I offer a personal perspective on what it's about, why it's important, why it's reasonable to conjecture that P ≠ NP is both true and provable, why proving it is so hard, the landscape of related problems, and crucially, what progress has been made in the last half-century toward solving those problems. The discussion of progress includes diagonalization and circuit lower bounds; the relativization, algebrization, and natural proofs barriers; and the recent works of Ryan Williams and Ketan Mulmuley, which (in different ways) hint at a duality between impossibility proofs and algorithms.",
