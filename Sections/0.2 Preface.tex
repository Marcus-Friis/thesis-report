This project has been a long journey, and throughout the process, we have received many helping hands. First and foremost, we would like to take this opportunity to thank Luca Rossi for being an absolutely outstanding supervisor on all accounts. Working together with him has been both highly educational and a genuine pleasure. We also extend our gratitude to Michele Coscia, for providing much needed support on the technicalities of frequent subgraph mining, Matteo Magnani and Alessia Galdeman, for providing valuable expert feedback on the project, and Marilena Hohmann, for sharing the Twitter data used in the project.
