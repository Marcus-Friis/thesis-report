\section{TikTok}

TikTok is a global video sharing service released in 2016, quickly growing to become the most popular app in 2019 and 2020, now having more than a billion users. The main way to use it is via a personalized video feed, showing generally short vertical videos. Anyone can upload a video and have the algorithm show it in other users feeds. TikTok earns money mainly by showing commercials in the form of paid videos in feeds, and users are paid by views or external ways like sponsors and merchandise.
